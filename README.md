# Current Understanding

## **proto** 


### **proto.rs**

Define what data will be stored inside the blockchain. Messages described in this file will be serialized before entering the blockchain/being transferred between nodes/being transferred from a light client. Messages are serialized into a binary format.

### **mod.rs** 

Defines where protobuf generated rust files (which are used for data serialization and deserialization) are outputed (output to **protobuf_mod.rs**).



## **root**



### **build.rs**

Where we introduce a main function to generate rust files from proto descriptions. We define an output of **protobuf_mod.rs** and a source of **src/proto**.

The dependency **ProtobufGenerator** generates the corresponding rs files from our proto definitions.  


## **src**



### **lib.rs**

Main entry point of the application.

### **wallets.rs**

Where we provide the validation for wallet proto messages. The **ProtobufConvert** dependency allows us to map our structures and structures generated from our **service.proto**. Validation is provided by making sure defined structures here match those defined in the proto file, where structs here must have the same fields as those in proto.

We also define an implementation of wallet methods, where one is used to increase balance, and one is used to decrease. Consider this section almost like a constructor in Java, with two associated methods.

### **schema.rs**

Where provide a structured view of data storage. We dont access the storage directly, but instead we use **Access**. **Access** wraps udnerlying data access types like **Snapshot** (which provides an immutable view of data in our db) and **Fork** (which provides a mutable view of data in our db).

Our structured view of wallets in **schema.rs** is identical to the layout of the db in storage, so we dont need to write code to connect it to our db. Instead, we use the **FromAccess** trait from the **exonum_derive** dependency to generate this code for us.

Data will be stored in a key value format the MerkleDB index **MapIndex**. This data is stored as serialized wallet structures. 

**FromAccess** provides a method known as **from_root**, which can allow us to initialize our **CurrencySchema**. We also create a constructor using this method, to simplify interaction with **CurrencySchema**.
